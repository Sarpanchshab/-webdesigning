    <p class="b"> Network engineers are responsible for designing, maintaining, implementing,
         and troubleshooting an organizationâ€™s computer networks. Their tasks include 
         configuring and maintaining network hardware and software, ensuring network 
         security and integrity, monitoring network performance, and troubleshooting 
         network issues. Network engineers focus on the underlying infrastructure that
          enables communication and data transfer between different devices and systems.

    <p class="b">Software engineers, on the other hand, are responsible for designing,
         developing, and maintaining software systems and applications. Their tasks
          include writing codes, testing software programs, and working with other team 
          members to design and implement new features. Software engineers focus on 
          developing software solutions that run on top of the infrastructure.
